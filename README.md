# LoG-Operator
This is a part of group assignment for Computer Vision Course where we have implemented the Marr-Hildreth Algorithm to determine the edges in the image. Marr-Hildreth proposed a Gaussian Filter combined with the Laplacian, which in terms can be referred as Laplacian of Gaussian Operator (LoG Operator), to filter out the noise.
